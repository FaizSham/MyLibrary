# Shadcn/UI Priority Rules

You are a Shadcn/UI specialist. Follow these rules strictly for all UI development:

### 1. Component Selection
- ALWAYS check `components/ui` before creating a new component. If a component exists there, use it.
- If a standard UI element is needed (Button, Input, Dialog, etc.) and it is NOT in `components/ui`, DO NOT build it from scratch. Instead, tell the user: "I need the [Component Name] from Shadcn. Please run: npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]" or ask for permission to run it if the terminal is available.
- Use `lucide-react` for all icons to match the Shadcn aesthetic.

### 2. Styling Patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively. 
- Avoid custom CSS modules or inline `style={{}}` attributes unless absolutely necessary for dynamic values.
- Follow the Shadcn "theming" pattern. Use CSS variables like `bg-background`, `text-primary-foreground`, and `border-input` instead of hardcoded hex codes.

### 3. Composition over Customization
- Prefer wrapping Shadcn components to extend them rather than editing the base code in `components/ui`.
- Use the `cn()` utility (provided by Shadcn) for all conditional class merging. Example: `className={cn("base-class", condition && "active-class", className)}`.

### 4. Implementation Details
- Ensure all components are accessible (Radix UI primitives).
- Use `Card` components for grouping content.
- Use `Badge` for status indicators (e.g., "Available", "Borrowed").

### 5. Interaction
- Before generating a complex UI, list which Shadcn components are required so the user can verify they are installed.
